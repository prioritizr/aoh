        is no population data available for this species.","habitats":"Based on the
        Pacific lowland distribution of this species (Köhler 2010), the habitat is
        most likely mixed savanna and semi-deciduous forest (Stuart 1943), as well
        as evergreen forests.","threats":"This species'' likely habitat was and remains
        under threat from habitat conversion for development and agriculture. This
        has been particularly noted for the Pacific lowlands of Mexico and Central
        America (Stuart 1943, Duellmann 1999). However, it is unknown how this is
        affecting the species.","measures":"Parts of the range coincide with protected
        areas (for example La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve). Conservation needs include
        further research into threats and their effects on the population, as well

        range coincides with some protected areas this species is potentially threatened
        by habitat destruction for agricultural development. The species has, however,
        not received much research attention, and it is unknown to what degree habitat
