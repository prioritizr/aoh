        species is known only from the vicinity of the type locality: Comarapa, Province
        Manuel M. Caballero, in the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia (Patton and
        Emmons 2015). It may range more widely, although it may also be restricted
        to the currently known range, which covers an area less than 100 km². It has
        been found at an elevation of 1,800 m asl, although the terrain around the
        town of Comarapa reaches 2,500 m. The second and only known specimen of this
        species was collected 8 km west of Comarapa, by road, at an elevation of 2,270
        m (O.P Pearson field notes, MVZ archives).","population":"It is a rare species,
        which has either gone locally extinct or its abundance has been severely impacted
        (Patton and Emmons 2015). Additional field work is critically needed in the
        type locality and areas in diverse valleys region of central Bolivia.","habitats":"It
        is associated with rocky areas within cloud forest (O.J. Pearson field notes,
        MVZ archives). It is not known from outside of cloud forest, and may be specialized
        to rocky areas in this habitat. This rodent is vegetarian and lives in burrows.
        In common with other hystricognath rodents, it gives birth to precocial young
        after presumably a lengthy gestation period (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).","threats":"Major
        threats to this species include clearance of cloud forest for cattle pasture.
        The range of the species is divided by a road, along which human colonization
        is taking place, further fragmenting the habitat. \u003cem\u003eAbrocoma\u003c/em\u003e
        species have previously been collected for their fur, although it does not
        seem that this species was affected by the fur trade. A pregnant adult female
        \u003cem\u003eA. boliviensis\u003c/em\u003e was documented inside a local
        snake species (\u003cem\u003eBoiruna maculata)\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#160;stomach
        (Munoz 2015).","measures":"This rodent is not known to occur in any protected
        areas. There is an urgent need to protect the distinct area of Comarapa. Further
        research is needed in this area to try to find additional populations.","use_trade":null,"rationale":"Listed
