        species is known only from the vicinity of the type locality: Comarapa, Province
        Manuel M. Caballero, in the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia (Patton and
        Emmons 2015). It may range more widely, although it may also be restricted
        to the currently known range, which covers an area less than 100 km². It has
        been found at an elevation of 1,800 m asl, although the terrain around the
        town of Comarapa reaches 2,500 m. The second and only known specimen of this
        species was collected 8 km west of Comarapa, by road, at an elevation of 2,270
        m (O.P Pearson field notes, MVZ archives).","population":"It is a rare species,
        which has either gone locally extinct or its abundance has been severely impacted
        (Patton and Emmons 2015). Additional field work is critically needed in the
        type locality and areas in diverse valleys region of central Bolivia.","habitats":"It
        is associated with rocky areas within cloud forest (O.J. Pearson field notes,
        MVZ archives). It is not known from outside of cloud forest, and may be specialized
        to rocky areas in this habitat. This rodent is vegetarian and lives in burrows.
        In common with other hystricognath rodents, it gives birth to precocial young
        after presumably a lengthy gestation period (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).","threats":"Major
        threats to this species include clearance of cloud forest for cattle pasture.
        The range of the species is divided by a road, along which human colonization
        is taking place, further fragmenting the habitat. \u003cem\u003eAbrocoma\u003c/em\u003e
        species have previously been collected for their fur, although it does not
        seem that this species was affected by the fur trade. A pregnant adult female
        \u003cem\u003eA. boliviensis\u003c/em\u003e was documented inside a local
        snake species (\u003cem\u003eBoiruna maculata)\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#160;stomach
        (Munoz 2015).","measures":"This rodent is not known to occur in any protected

        celebensis\u003c/em\u003e is endemic to the Sulawesi subregion of Indonesia.  Historically,
        the species and its colonies were found throughout  Sulawesi, but in recent
        years, intensive hunting has led to extirpation  of colonies in North Sulawesi,
        with occasional anecdotal reports of  foraging within Tangkoko Nature Reserve.
        It is also known from Buton,  Mangole, Sanana, Siau, Sangihe, and Selayar
        islands. The “Malenge,  Togian Islands” reference from Musser \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e (1982) is  incorrectly taken from the Tate (1942) monograph
        of the specimens from  the Archbold Expedition. It is primarily a lowland
        species, occurring  from sea level up to 1,500 m asl. Its area of occupancy
        (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EO)O are declining due to  continuing habitat
        loss and degradation.\u003c/p\u003e","population":"While there is no global
        population estimate for \u003cem\u003eAcerodon celebensis\u003c/em\u003e,
        it is suspected that hunting and habitat loss has caused reduction in the
        species’ population and the number of mature individuals of at least 30% over
        the past three generations (GL = 4.5 years; 13.5 years; Pacifici \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e 2013). Known roost sites are at constant threat from hunting
        pressures and some sites have been decimated due to over hunting and lack
        of protection. The population is in decline due to unsustainable levels of
        hunting and is suspected to have been extirpated from North Sulawesi (Sheherazade
        and Tsang 2015, Latinne \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2020). The species

        in villages . It is commonly found both inland (up to 1,500 m asl)  and along
        the coast and shows a medium tolerance of human disturbance.  Currently, large
        colonies of \u003cem\u003eA. celebensis\u003c/em\u003e are only known from
        mangrove  forests where they roost with \u003cem\u003ePteropus alecto \u003c/em\u003eon

        and  October (S. Heinrichs pers. comm. 2012).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe
        species is found to  migrate seasonally following local weather conditions

        2019). They help to  ensure the regeneration of forests in Sulawesi and act
        as significant  pollinators of durian, an economically important crop in Sulawesi  (Sheherazade
        \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2019). In fruit orchards in West Sulawesi,  they
        also feed on rambutan (\u003cem\u003eNephelium lappaceum\u003c/em\u003e) and
        langsat (\u003cem\u003eLansium  domesticum\u003c/em\u003e) fruits. During

        threats to \u003cem\u003eAcerodon celebensis\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cem\u003e
        \u003c/em\u003ehunting, persecution, and deforestation. The species is commonly
        hunted and is found in bushmeat markets of North Sulawesi for local and regional
        trade with 600,000 to 1,000,000 bats taken annually (Sheherazade and Tsang
        2015, Latinne \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2020). They are hunted throughout
        their entire range to satiate the demand for bushmeat in North Sulawesi, where
        they have been locally extirpated. Known roost sites are at constant threat
        from hunting pressures, and some sites have been decimated due to overhunting
        and lack of protection. In a few areas in Central Sulawesi with predominantly
        non-Muslim residents, flying foxes are occasionally hunted at foraging sites
        for food. In fruit orchards in West Sulawesi, flying foxes were killed by
        the community because they fed on rambutan (\u003cem\u003eNephelium lappaceum\u003c/em\u003e)
        and langsat (\u003cem\u003eLansium domesticum\u003c/em\u003e) fruits. Deforestation
        due to logging and agriculture is occurring throughout the species'' range
        and mangroves, where the largest colonies are currently found, are being converted
        to shrimp aquaculture.","measures":"The species is listed on CITES Appendix
        II.  Although the species is  known to occasionally forage in protected areas,
        there are no large  colonies located within protected areas nor are they granted
        formal  protection.  In some areas (such as Watansoppeng in South Sulawesi)
        they  are protected, because local people believe this bat brings good  fortune.
        They believe when the flying foxes are gone, a disaster will  happen to the
        city. Consequently, Watansoppeng established a local  regulation to protect
        their flying fox colonies that roost in the city  center. Further, in fruit
        orchards in West Sulawesi, flying foxes were  killed by the community because
        they fed on rambutan (\u003cem\u003eNephelium  lappaceum\u003c/em\u003e) and
        langsat (\u003cem\u003eLansium domesticum\u003c/em\u003e) fruits. After learning
        about  the role of flying foxes in pollinating durian, which was a major cash  crop
        at the fruit orchards, the local community decided to switch to  non-lethal
        methods to deter the bats, such as using a bell or hanging  the internal organs
        of rotten fish on the fruit trees (Sheherazade  2018).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe
        conservation NGO Alliance for Tompotika Conservation  (AlTo) has protected
        a flying fox colony since 2014 through a  conservation lease with the local
        community on Tangkuladi Island,  Banggai, Central Sulawesi and are informally
        monitoring the population.  It has their education programs to educate the
        community about bats.  Close to Tangkuladi Island, a conservation NGO, PROGRES
        (Sulawesi  Regional Ecological Conservation Initiative, established their
        flying  fox conservation program in 2018. Combining science and community-based  approaches,
        PROGRES has empowered the local community to protect flying  fox colonies
        from hunting and set up the first scientific, long-term  monitoring program
        of flying fox populations. They created books and  posters about flying foxes,
        conducted outreach programs in Central  Sulawesi for children at schools and
        in the villages, and arranged movie  screenings about bats attended by fishermen
        and women from the  villages. In North Sulawesi, Selamatkan Yaki has started
        to include bats  in their trade mitigation programs and WCS Indonesia has
        supported the  North Sulawesi Nature Conservation Agency (BKSDA Sulawesi Utara),
        a  government entity, to address the bushmeat trade.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMore
        studies on  the species populations trends are needed, including on population
        size  and distribution throughout its range. Also, needed are studies of the  species’
        habitat requirements to better understand the effects of forest  conversion
        and land use change. Finally, studies are needed to  determine the amount
        of hunting of this species and the impact of the  bushmeat trade on population
        persistence. Like most threatened flying  foxes, local capacity building for
        conservation managers and education  and awareness within local communities
        are sorely needed to support  conservation efforts.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","use_trade":"The

        meet the demand of the international bushmeat trade.","rationale":"\u003cem\u003eAcerodon

        hunting pressure as this species is endemic to the Sulawesi subregion of Indonesia
        and has been suspected to be extirpated locally in North Sulawesi, the centre
        of the bushmeat trade at unsustainable rates (Sheherazade and Tsang 2015).

        none have official government protection, a few colonies have been protected
        by the local community in collaboration with conservation NGOs. Further, large
        colonies primarily occur in mangrove forests, which have drastically declined
        due to conversion to shrimp aquacultures. The continued hunting and loss of
        critical mangrove habitats over the next decade will likely result in the

        in forest blocks protected under a newly established protected area and the

        (though it is unclear whether the species occurred in any of these roosts
        historically (Mildenstein 2011)): 1) Cebu: Tabunan, 2) Mindanao: Bongo Island,
        Maguindanao Province, and Pinol and Maitum, Sarangani Province, 3) Negros
        Oriental (southeast Negros): Sagay, Vallehermosa and San Jose, and 4) Panay:
        Batbatan Island and Culasi, Antique Province. The Siquijor populations are
        possibly extinct (Lepiten 1995), this species has been reported absent from
        there recently (A.B. Cariño pers. comm. 2006).","population":"A rough estimate
        of the total population of \u003cem\u003eA. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e is around
        10,000 individuals (and probably no more than 20,000) (Mildenstein 2011, 2012).
        During the late 1800s and early 1900s there were many anecdotal reports of
        colonies of 100,000 bats, presumably mixed species. Hence, the total population
        of\u003cem\u003e A. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e is estimated to be around one or
        two percent of what it was 200 years ago (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2006). Although
        there are still a few mixed species colonies that number between 10,000 and
        30,000 individuals, generally, recent observations of mixed colonies have
        reported sizes of 5,000 and fewer individuals (Mildenstein 2011, 2012), and
        concur with surveys from the last three decades (Heaney and Heideman 1987,
        Heaney and Utzurrum 1991, Mudar and Allen 1986, Rickart \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eet

        1992).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePrior to fruit bat population surveys
        of the early 2000’s, most colonies of large fruit bats were assumed to include
        \u003cem\u003eAcerodon jubatus\u003c/em\u003e, although the actual presence
        of the species in many colonies was not confirmed. Recent work by the Bat
        Count Project has shown that the number of remaining\u003cem\u003e A. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e
        populations is fewer and population sizes are smaller than were thought to
        exist historically. Many fruit bat colonies do not have any \u003cem\u003eA.
        jubatus\u003c/em\u003e at all, and when it is present, it has always been
        found in mixed species roosts with \u003cem\u003ePteropus vampyrus\u003c/em\u003e
        (and sometimes also with \u003cem\u003ePteropus hypomelanus\u003c/em\u003e).
        Of the 23 roosts sampled by Bat Count, only nine of these were found to contain
        \u003cem\u003eA. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e during several survey days for each
        roost. For other roosts surveyed by Bat Count Philippines, the presence of
        the species was not documented, but repeat visits are necessary to confirm
        absence. It is not known whether colonies lacking\u003cem\u003e A. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e
        represent extirpated locations or if the species was not found in these sites
        historically.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFor most colonies known to be of
        mixed species, it is often unknown how abundant each species is in the colony
        (i.e. the species composition) (Mildenstein \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eet

        jubatus\u003c/em\u003e make up a small proportion of the total colony size,
        ranging from \u003cem\u003eA. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e making up around 5% of
        the mixed species population to as much as 20% of the individuals in the two

        forest removal is on-going. In Samar and Pangasinan (Luzon), open-cast mines
        are removing forest cover (M. Pedregosa pers. comm. 2006) and in southwestern
        Negros, a roost of this species occurs in a copper and gold mining claim area

        of flying foxes is illegal in the Philippines (except for the few remaining

        unregulated throughout the country. Reasons for hunting fruit bats in the
        Philippines vary. Fruit bats hunting is part of Filipino cultural heritage,
        and fruit bat meat is valued as a delicacy and/or for its medicinal properties
        (Cariño \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e 2006,
        Mildenstein 2012). Fruit bats may also be relied upon as an opportunistic
        food source for forest workers (Gomez in litt. 2007, T. Mildenstein and S.
        Stier pers. comm. 2012). Finally, fruit bats are valued for sport hunting
        and as ‘pulutan’ (any snack eaten while consuming alcohol) (Cariño \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Depending on seasonal
        demands, local markets for fruit bats occur throughout the Philippines. Specific
        reports of local trade include on Negros Island, where individual bats can
        be sold for 15-30 pesos (0.30 -0.60US$) (Cariño \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eet

        buyers think of \u003cem\u003eA. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e as quite odourous
        compared to \u003cem\u003eP. vampyrus\u003c/em\u003e (S. Stier, pers. comm.

        is less preferred to \u003cem\u003ePteropus vampyrus\u003c/em\u003e because
        of this quality, but the species look similar, and hunters are generally not

        2011), shot guns, rifles, and air guns (T. Mildenstein, pers. comm. 2010,
        and A. Cariño in litt. 2007). The impact of hunting on fruit bat populations
        is greatest when it occurs at the roost site, which causes stress and risk
        of mortality across the entire colony. Species differ in their tolerance of
        roost site disturbance, with more specialized species expected to be more
        sensitive. \u003cem\u003eA. jubatus\u003c/em\u003e populations exhibit a 12-fold
        reduction in population density when roost sites are unprotected compared
        to protected roosts with the same amount of surrounding habitat (Mildenstein
        2012). Three roost sites (Boracay, Subic Bay, Luzon, and Mambukal, Negros)
        are formally protected from hunting by local landowners (Boracay) and the
        local government (Subic Bay and Mambukal), although occasional hunting is
        still known to occur at all three locations. At most other roost sites, \u003cem\u003eA.
        jubatus\u003c/em\u003e experiences regular hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012).
        Many flying fox colonies have moved from their original roosting sites due
        to hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012), (e.g. Patag, Negros Occidental, Calinawan,
        Negros Oriental,Davao Oriental, Mindanao (A.B. Cariño pers. comm. 2007, Gomez

        the roost is known to be on-going in Subic Bay (S. Stier and T. Mildenstein

        areas, where they are subjected to disturbances caused by tourists and guides
        (e.g. clapping hands or deliberately tapping the roost trees to make them
        fly). In addition to causing more stress during a period when the bats are
        normally sleeping, there have been a number of reports of pups that got separated
