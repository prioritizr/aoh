 \item Global elevation and habitat classification are imported
  (if needed,
  see [get_global_elevation_data()] and [get_lumb_cgls_habitat_data()]
  for details).
  If these data are not available in the cache directory
  (i.e. argument to `cache_dir`), then they are automatically downloaded
  to the cache directory.
  Note that if elevation and habitat data are supplied
  (i.e. as arguments to `elevation_data` and `habitat_data`), then
  the user-supplied datasets are used to generate Area of Habitat data.

\item The Area of Habitat data are then generated for each seasonal
  distribution of each species. For a given species' distribution,
  the data are generated by
  (i) cropping the habitat classification and elevation data to the spatial
  extent  of the species' seasonal distribution;
  (ii) converting the habitat classification data to a binary layer
  denoting suitable habitat for the species' distribution
   (using the habitat affiliation data for the species' distribution);
  (iii) creating a mask based on the species' elevational limits
  and the elevation data, and then using the mask to set values
  in the binary layer to zero if they are outside of the species'
  limits;
  (iv) creating a mask by rasterizing the species' seasonal
  distribution, and then using the mask to set values in the binary
  layer to missing (`NA`) values if they are outside the species'
  distribution;
  (v) saving the binary layer as the Area of Habitat data
  for the species' distribution.
  Note that species' distributions that already have Area of Habitat data
  available in the output directory are skipped
  (unless the argument to `force` is `TRUE`).
