 \item Global elevation and habitat classification are imported
  (if needed,
  see [get_global_elevation_data()] and [get_lumbierres_habitat_data()]
  for details).
  If these data are not available in the cache directory
  (i.e. argument to `cache_dir`), then they are automatically downloaded
  to the cache directory.
  Note that if elevation and habitat data are supplied
  (i.e. as arguments to `elevation_data` and `habitat_data`), then
  the user-supplied datasets are used to generate Area of Habitat data.

\item Species range data cleaned to prepare them for subsequent
  analysis. Briefly, this process involves excluding places where the
  (i) species' presence is not _extant_ or
   _probably extant_
   (i.e. filtering based on `presence == 1` or `presence == 2`);
  (ii) species' origin is not _native_,
  _reintroduced_, or the result of _assisted colonization_
   (i.e. filtering based on `origin == 1`, `origin == 2`, or `origin == 6`);
  (iii) available information on which species' seasonal distribution
  is _uncertain_
  (i.e. filtering based on `seasonal != 5`); and
  (iv) species' distribution is not terrestrial
  (i.e. filtering based on where `terrestrial == "true"`).
  Additionally, the species' range data are spatially dissolved so that each
  seasonal distribution for each taxon is represented by a separate geometry.
  Finally, geoprocessing routines are used to detect and repair
  any invalid geometries.

\item Species' altitudinal limit and habitat affiliation data are
  imported
  (if needed,
  see [get_spp_summary_data()] and [get_spp_habitat_data()] for details).
  If these data are not available in the cache directory
  (i.e. argument to `cache_dir`), then they are automatically downloaded
  to the cache directory
  Note that if species' altitudinal limit and habitat affiliation
  data are supplied (i.e. as arguments to `spp_summary_data` and
  `spp_habitat_data`), then the user-supplied datasets are used to generate
  Area of Habitat data.

\item The species data are collated into a single dataset containing
  their geographic ranges, altitudinal limits, and habitat affiliations.
  Specifically, taxon identifiers (per the `id_no`/`SISID` columns)
  are used merge the datasets together.
  If a species lacks lower or upper altitudinal limits,
  then limits of 0 and 9,000 m are assumed respectively
  (following Lumbierres *et al.* 2021).
  Additionally, the following rules are used to assign
  habitat affiliations for species' distributions.
  First, habitat affiliations are only
  included in the collated dataset if they are classified as *suitable*
  or *major*.
  Second, if a habitat affiliation is defined for a specific seasonal
  distribution of a particular species (e.g. *non-breeding*), then that
  habitat affiliation is only assigned to that specific seasonal
  distribution for the species.
  Third, if a habitat affiliation is not defined for a specific
  seasonal distribution, then the habitat is assigned to all seasonal
  distributions associated with the species.
  Fourth, because the *resident* distributions of some bird species
  lack specific habitat affiliation data, the habitat affiliation data
  for these *resident* distributions are assigned based on habitat
  affiliations for the species' *breeding* distribution.

\item The Area of Habitat data are then generated for each seasonal
  distribution of each species. For a given species' distribution,
  the data are generated by
  (i) cropping the habitat classification and elevation data to the spatial
  extent  of the species' seasonal distribution;
  (ii) converting the habitat classification data to a binary layer
  denoting suitable habitat for the species' distribution
   (using the habitat affiliation data for the species' distribution);
  (iii) creating a mask based on the species' altitudinal limits
  and the elevation data, and then using the mask to set values
  in the binary layer to zero if they are outside of the species'
  limits;
  (iv) creating a mask by rasterizing the species' seasonal
  distribution, and then using the mask to set values in the binary
  layer to missing (`NA`) values if they are outside the species'
  distribution;
  (v) saving the binary layer as the Area of Habitat data
  for the species' distribution.
  Note that species' distributions that already have Area of Habitat data
  available in the output directory are skipped
  (unless the argument to `force` is `TRUE`).
